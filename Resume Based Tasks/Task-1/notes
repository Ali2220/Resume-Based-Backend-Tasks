🔥 Task 1: Real-Time Chat Backend (Design + Code)
🧠 Problem Statement

You are building a real-time chat system (similar to Flux).

Users can:

Join chat rooms

Send messages

Fetch previous messages when joining

This is backend only.

🛠 Requirements
1️⃣ Design MongoDB Schemas

Create Mongoose schemas for:

User

ChatRoom

Message

Minimum fields:

Message must belong to:

a user

a room

Messages should be fetchable room-wise

System should scale to thousands of messages

2️⃣ API Endpoints (REST)

Design endpoints for:

Create chat room

Send message

Fetch last 50 messages of a room (pagination ready)

3️⃣ One Real-Time Question (Very Important)

Answer this clearly:

👉 Why do we still need REST APIs when we already have Socket.IO for chat?

⏱ Time Limit

15 minutes

✅ Expected Outcome

Proper schema relationships (ref)

Scalable thinking (no embedding 10k messages in one doc)

Clean endpoint design

Clear explanation (not essay)

🧾 What I Want in Your Reply

Reply with:

User, ChatRoom, Message schemas

REST API routes (just route + purpose, full code not required)

Short answer to Socket.IO vs REST question (4–5 lines max)
